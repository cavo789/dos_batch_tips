# Loop

> See [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Windows_Batch_Scripting#FOR](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Windows_Batch_Scripting#FOR) for much more way to make a loop

Simple loop, from 1 till 5

```batch
<!-- concat-md::include "./files/loops_for.cmd" -->
```

Loop from 1 till 20, only odd numbers

```batch
<!-- concat-md::include "./files/loops_odd.cmd" -->
```
